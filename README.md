# Backend Microservices

## I utilized a "right tool for the job" approach, implementing different frameworks within the monorepo:

    Hono: Used for its edge-compatibility and zero-latency routing.
    Fastify: Leveraged for its high-performance JSON schema validation and speed.
    Vanilla Node.js: Kept lightweight for core utility functions.
    
## Features

    Turborepo Pipeline: Optimized build caching and task execution.
    Microservices: Decoupled architecture allowing independent scaling and deployment.
    Shared Types: End-to-end type safety between backend services and frontend apps.
    Performance: Optimized Lighthouse scores (LCP/CLS) and reduced API overhead.
    
## Utilities

# This Turborepo has some additional configurations that I've added to help with development:
    TypeScript for static type checking
    ESLint for code linting
    Prettier for code formatting
